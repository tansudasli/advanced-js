It is all about where js ends and ts starts.

- index2.html, app.ts and event.ts : prototype for event app



## How to Run

for most of the ts files,

- [x] just `tsc interfaces.ts && node interfaces.js` or use IDE run 

if there is need for index.html file, then

- [x] `tsc ..ts` to get ...js file, then run index.html from IDE
